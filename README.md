# What is this?

This is a dead-simple headless CMS. No fancy dashboards, no bloated page builders, no “enterprise-ready omnichannel synergy”.
Just a clean backend that stores your content and serves it fast. That’s it.

# Why?
Most headless CMS feel like they’re built for marketing teams with five layers of approval and a mandatory “Content Strategist” role. I don’t need that.
I just want something lightweight that stays out of my way, doesn’t force workflows on me, and simply delivers structured data to a couple of websites and apps.
This project is exactly that:
> A minimal, predictable CMS that does its job without drama.
